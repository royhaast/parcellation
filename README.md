# Parcellation
Test scripts for parcellation

## TODO:
- [ ] Read Arslan 2017, discuss selected clustering algorithms
- [ ] Select a range of NR. of clusters based on literature and compare them with stability measures (eg. silhouette index)
- [ ] Group vs individual, or pooled individual maps?
- [ ] ASL, with or without?
- [ ] Effects of the clustering on connectivity analyses
